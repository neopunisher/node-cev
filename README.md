# node-cev

> Typed, calibrated decisions from a small local model, in one forward pass.

[cev](https://github.com/CarterCole/rust-cev) for Node.js. You give it program
state and typed questions: **is this true** (`noul`), **which of these**
(`choice`), **which level** (`score`). It gives back typed answers with
probabilities. The model never generates text, so an answer outside the
options you listed is impossible, and a request takes tens of milliseconds.

This package runs the cev engine inside your Node process as a native addon:
no server, no HTTP. It uses the GPU on a Mac, Apple's BLAS or all the cores on
a CPU, and never blocks the event loop. Every answer is logged with an id, so
you can send the right answer back later and the model learns from it while it
runs.

[![CI](https://github.com/neopunisher/node-cev/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neopunisher/node-cev/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

```js
import { Cev } from 'node-cev';

const cev = await Cev.load({ model: 'Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B' });

const { answers } = await cev.decide({
  state: { ticket: 'The app crashes when I tap Log in' },
  questions: {
    team: { type: 'choice', instructions: 'Which team?', criteria: { billing: 'Payments', tech: 'Bugs and crashes' } },
    refund: { type: 'noul', instructions: 'Is a refund requested?' },
    severity: { type: 'score', instructions: 'How severe?', criteria: ['Cosmetic', 'Degraded', 'Blocking'] },
  },
});

answers.team.choice;        // 'tech'    (typed as 'billing' | 'tech')
answers.team.probabilities; // { billing: 0, tech: 1 }
answers.refund.noul;        // 0.007     probability of yes
answers.severity.score;     // 1.51      expected level: { 0: 0.015, 1: 0.459, 2: 0.525 }

// Later, when you know the right answer:
await cev.feedback({ decision_id: answers.severity.x_cev.decision_id, label: 2 });
```

## Install

There are no prebuilt binaries on npm yet, so for now you build the addon
from source. That needs Node.js >= 22, a Rust toolchain, and the engine checked
out next to this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarterCole/rust-cev
git clone https://github.com/neopunisher/node-cev
cd node-cev && npm install && npm run build
```

Then depend on the folder (`npm install ../node-cev`) or `npm link` it. See
[Building from source](#building-from-source) for GPU features.

Weights are not bundled. `Cev.load` takes a Hugging Face repo id or a local
directory with a Qwen3 safetensors checkpoint. It looks in the Hugging Face
cache first, then in `~/.cache/cev/models`, and downloads into the latter if
the model is in neither (`HF_TOKEN` is honoured).

| Model | Download | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` | 1.5 GB | fastest; weaker on judgement calls (it scores the login crash above as cosmetic) |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` | 4.1 GB | the default |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` | | wants a GPU |
| a directory | | a LoRA fine-tune from rust-cev's `training/train_lora.py`, or an int8 copy from its `quantize` example (CPU only) |

## Questions and answers

A request is a `state` (free text or any JSON value) and one or more named
questions. They are all answered in the same forward pass, each as if it had
been asked alone.

| `type` | Asks | `criteria` | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `noul` | is this true? | optional: what counts as yes, or `{ true, false }` descriptions | `noul`: probability of yes |
| `choice` | which of these? | `{ name: description }`, or `['name', ...]` | `choice`, `confidence`, `probabilities` by name |
| `score` | which level? | level descriptions, lowest first | `score` (expected level index), `confidence`, `probabilities` by index, `legend` |

Up to 255 options per question and 256 questions per request. Every answer
also has `x_cev`: its `decision_id`, its `task`, and whether an online adapter
adjusted it.

In TypeScript the answers are typed from the questions you pass:
`answers.team.choice` above is `'billing' | 'tech'`, `answers.refund` has
`noul` and no `choice`. Requests and responses are the bodies of cev's REST API
field for field (`POST /v1/systemone` and friends), which is why they are
snake_case; only the options of `Cev.load` are camelCase.

Small models favour whichever option is listed first. cev corrects for that on
every request (`debias`):

| `debias` | Does | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | the raw distribution | |
| `calibrate` | subtracts what the model answers to the same question over empty evidence | free after the first request with a question |
| `permute` | averages over rotations of the option order (up to `maxPermutations`) | more tokens in the pass |
| `full` (default) | both | about 2x `calibrate` |

## Feedback and online learning

Send the right answer back and cev stores it with the decision. With
`onlineLearning` (the default) it also updates a small per-task adapter on top
of the frozen model: a temperature, a bias per option and a linear probe on the
model's own hidden state.

```js
const res = await cev.decide({ state, questions: { team: { type: 'choice', instructions: 'Which team?', criteria, task: 'router.team' } } });

await cev.feedback({ decision_id: res.answers.team.x_cev.decision_id, label: 'billing' });
// or: { request_id: res.request_id, question_id: 'team', label: 'billing', comment: '...', metadata: { by: 'agent-7' } }

await cev.tasks();
// [{ task: 'router.team', examples: 12, active: true, base_loss: 0.71, adapted_loss: 0.33, ... }]
```

- A **task** is one decision you make repeatedly. Give questions a `task` name;
  without one the key is a hash of the type, instructions and option names, so
  rewording a question starts a new adapter.
- An adapter is **served only once it has `minExamples` labels and beats the
  base model** on labels it had not yet seen. Until then, and whenever it stops
  winning, you get the base model. `x_cev.adapted` says which one answered.
- Labels: `true`/`false` or a probability for `noul`; the option name for
  `choice`; a level index for `score` (fractions split between neighbours); or
  a full distribution `{ option: probability }` for any of them.
- `cev.examples([{ state, questions, labels }])` decides and labels in one
  call, for seeding a task with examples you already have.

## The decision log

Pass `db: 'cev.db'` to keep decisions, feedback and adapters in a SQLite file
across restarts. The default is in memory. `no_store: true` on a request skips
the log (its answers then cannot take feedback).

```js
await cev.decisions({ task: 'router.team', limit: 20 }); // recent decisions
await cev.decision(id);   // { decision, state, prompt, feedback } with the exact text the model saw
await cev.stats();        // { store: { requests, decisions, feedback, labeled_decisions }, tasks, model }

// Training rows for an offline LoRA fine-tune (rust-cev's training/train_lora.py --source labels.jsonl)
await writeFile('labels.jsonl', await cev.exportNdjson());
const rows = await cev.export({ labeled: false }); // the same, parsed; every decision, labelled or not
```

## API

Everything except `model`, `close()` and `info()` returns a promise.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `Cev.load(options?)` | load a model |
| `Cev.mock(options?)` | a keyword-overlap stand-in: no weights, instant, the whole API works. For tests |
| `cev.model` | `{ id, backbone, hidden_size, max_options, prompt_version, threads, concurrency }` |
| `cev.decide({ state, questions, debias?, no_store? })` | answer the questions |
| `cev.feedback({ decision_id \| request_id + question_id, label?, weight?, comment?, metadata? })` | label or comment on an answer |
| `cev.examples([{ state, questions, labels }])` | decide, then learn from the labels |
| `cev.tasks()` / `cev.resetTask(task)` | adapter status / drop an adapter (its labels stay) |
| `cev.decisions({ task?, limit?, offset? })` / `cev.decision(id)` | read the log |
| `cev.export(filter?)` / `cev.exportNdjson(filter?)` | training rows; filter by `task`, `model`, `labeled`, `since`, `limit` |
| `cev.stats()` | counts |
| `cev.close()` | free the model once the calls already made have settled |
| `info()` | what the addon was built with: `{ version, metal, accelerate, cuda, cores, performanceCores, threads }` |

### Options

| Option | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` | Hugging Face repo id or a directory |
| `device` | `auto` | `auto` (Metal, then CUDA, then CPU), `cpu`, `metal`, `cuda` |
| `dtype` | `auto` | `f32` on CPU and for checkpoints up to 4 GB on Metal, else `bf16`; or `f16` |
| `threads` | performance cores | CPU threads for the tensor kernels; see [Performance](#performance) |
| `concurrency` | `1` | forward passes that may run at once |
| `db` | `:memory:` | SQLite file for the log |
| `debias` | `full` | default for requests that do not set it |
| `maxPermutations` | `4` | most option rotations per question |
| `onlineLearning` | `true` | when false, labels are stored but nothing adapts |
| `minExamples` | `8` | labels before an adapter may be served |
| `storeFeatures` | `true` | keep hidden states with decisions; learning from later feedback needs them |
| `maxContext` | `32768` | longest prompt in tokens (capped by the model) |
| `prefixCacheTokens` | `65536` | tokens of state prefixes kept for reuse |
| `name` | `cev-<model>` | the `model` reported in responses |

`Cev.mock` takes the options from `db` to `storeFeatures`.

### Errors

Every rejection is a `CevError` with a `code`:

| `code` | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `bad_request` | the call was malformed: no questions, one option, a label that is not an option, an unknown option name |
| `not_found` | no such decision (was it made with `no_store`?) |
| `closed` | the instance was closed |
| `internal` | everything else: missing weights, a failed download, I/O |

Set `CEV_LOG=debug` to print the engine's log, including the time each pass
spent tokenizing, prefilling and answering, to stderr.

## Performance

Qwen3-0.6B, f32, on an Apple M4 Max (12 performance and 4 efficiency cores).
The request is the one rust-cev benchmarks with: a short ticket and 3 questions
(270 tokens with `calibrate`, 570 with `full`). "New state" is a state the
model has not seen; "same state" repeats it, so its prefix comes from the
cache. Median latency of one request at a time, in milliseconds:

| | `calibrate`: new / same state | `full`: new / same state | 3k-token state, `calibrate`: new / same |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| the engine as WebAssembly in Node (one thread) | 5200 / 3300 | 12200 / 10100 | |
| node-cev on the CPU | 183 / 130 | 391 / 325 | 3391 / 358 |
| node-cev on Metal | 46 / 35 | 88 / 77 | 600 / 66 |

Qwen3-1.7B: 382 / 266 and 758 / 674 on the CPU, 98 / 70 and 193 / 169 on
Metal. The very first request with a question costs about twice a new state
(its calibration is computed once and cached). Loading takes about half a
second once the weights are in the page cache. Reproduce with
`npm run bench -- --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --device cpu`.

### What the cores are doing

- **Nothing runs on the JavaScript thread.** `decide` queues a job for a native
  worker and returns a promise; feedback and log reads go to a separate worker,
  so they never wait behind a forward pass.
- **On a Mac, use Metal** (`device: 'auto'` does). It is 4 to 6 times faster
  than the CPU on the same machine.
- **On the CPU, a pass runs on a pool of `threads` threads**: the matmuls
  through Apple's Accelerate on macOS and through multi-threaded portable
  kernels elsewhere, the element-wise work (softmax, norms, rotary embedding)
  split over the pool. The default is the performance cores; efficiency cores
  slow a pass down because work is split evenly and everyone waits for the
  slowest. `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` or `threads` overrides it. The pool belongs to
  the process, so only the first `Cev.load` sets its size.
- **More threads stop helping a single request early on Apple silicon.** About
  70% of a CPU pass is matmul that Accelerate already runs at the chip's limit
  (about 1.9 TFLOP/s on the M4 Max), and that part does not scale with threads:

  | `threads` | 1 | 4 | 8 | 12 |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
  | short request, new / same state (ms) | 254 / 158 | 188 / 131 | 180 / 125 | 183 / 130 |
  | 3k-token state, new (ms) | 6542 | 3840 | 3389 | 3391 |

- **For throughput on the CPU, raise `concurrency`.** Several passes side by
  side use what one pass leaves idle. With 8 requests in flight, Qwen3-0.6B
  goes from 5.5 to 10.5 requests/s at `concurrency: 8` (1.7B: 2.6 to 4.1).
  Each request gets slower, so leave it at 1 if latency matters more. On a GPU
  it does nothing (21.8 requests/s on Metal either way): keep it at 1.
- **Ask your questions together.** One request with 12 questions takes 126 ms
  on Metal where 4 requests with 3 each take 180 ms, and the state is read
  once.
- **Keep the state prefix stable.** A request whose state was seen before skips
  straight to the questions (35 ms instead of 46; 66 ms instead of 600 for a 3k-token
  state). The cache matches on the rendered state, so put what changes last.
- `calibrate` is half the cost of `full` if you can live without the rotation
  averaging.

## Building from source

```bash
npm run build:native                      # cargo build -> cev.<platform>-<arch>.node
npm run build:native -- --features cuda   # NVIDIA GPUs (needs the CUDA toolkit)
npm run build:ts                          # src/ -> dist/
npm test                                  # mock backend; no weights needed
CEV_TEST_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B npm test   # also run a real model
```

- `native/` is a small Rust crate that links the cev crates from
  `../rust-cev` (`native/Cargo.toml`). macOS builds always include Metal and
  Accelerate; elsewhere the default build is CPU-only.
- The addon is looked up as `cev.<platform>-<arch>.node` in the package root
  (`linux-x64-gnu`, `linux-arm64-musl`, ... on Linux). `CEV_NATIVE=/path/to.node`
  loads another build instead.
- Only macOS on Apple silicon is tested so far. Linux and Windows should build
  (CPU, or CUDA with the feature) but have not been tried.

## How this relates to rust-cev

[rust-cev](https://github.com/CarterCole/rust-cev) is the project: the prompt
compiler, the Qwen3 engine, the decision log, the online learner, an HTTP and
GraphQL server, a browser build and a typed Rust SDK. This repository is only
the Node.js binding (about 400 lines of Rust glue and a typed wrapper), and
none of the engine is copied here. If you would rather run a server and call
it over HTTP from any language, use `cev-server` from rust-cev; its
`/v1/systemone` takes the same request this package's `decide` does.
